## Inspiration
I created this project for CS50's Web Programming with Python and Javascript offered on edX. The premise behind this project was to develop a Twitter-like social network website for making posts and following users. (the full specifications for this project can be found [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/4/network/)). From this project, I learned how to develop my own API.
